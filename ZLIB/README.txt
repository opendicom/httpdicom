Summary
=======

The ISO  needs to be read together with the APPNOTE and is a restriction of it. There is a quick restriction of the restrictions in Annex A, page 4:

- limits the compression options to none or deflated (method 8)
- removes encryption features
- removes signature features
- removes archive span on multiple containers
- supports ZIP64 version 1 only

In relation to deflate, points to the IETF RFC 1951 as the reference (instead of the APPNOTE)
